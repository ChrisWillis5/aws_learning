col:
product_name varchar(20),
manufacturingcost decimal(5,2)

'iphon11','iphone12','iphone13','iphoneSE','IpadMax','IpadMini','laptop256','Macbook512'],
'Samsung':['galaxy10','galaxy11','galaxy12','galaxy13','watch320','watch340'

create a table in redshift also.-- table name product_cost

2. Load data into s3 in separate folder (order data must be created earlier in class project 3).
3. Use copy command  to load data into redshift by.
4  create a view by joining order and product_cost.
5. Unload data from view into s3 bucket (this has to be separate bucket then created earlier)
