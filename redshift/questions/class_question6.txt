1. Create  a file:
col:
product_name varchar(20),
manufacturingcost decimal(5,2)

For each product build record using python script.
'iphon11','iphone12','iphone13','iphoneSE','IpadMax','IpadMini','laptop256','Macbook512',
'galaxy10','galaxy11','galaxy12','galaxy13','watch320','watch340'
'Nk320',''Nk400',''Nk500'

File example:
iphon11,220
iphone12,250
iphone13,290


create a table in redshift also.-- table name product_cost

2. Load data into s3 in separate folder (order data must be created earlier in class project 3).
3. Use copy command  to load data into redshift by.
4  create a view by joining order and product_cost.


5. Create a bucket using boto3 and then list the buckets (from the metadata). make sure the bucket exists else fail.
6. Unload data from view into s3 bucket (this has to be separate bucket then created earlier) buckets/transformation/vw_name/    (this has ot be a csv file with header)





## Hints
sql questin

import boto3

client = boto3.client('s3')
response = client.list_buckets()
print(response)
response = client.create_bucket(
Bucket='chris123')

session = boto3.Session(profile_name='dev_acct')
